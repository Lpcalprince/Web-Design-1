                    I’m so excited to finally share my new website with you!

                    As an ever evolving illustrator, creator or crafter I realized that the new content (that I am
                    willing to share with you) didn’t really fit into the old website layout. So the best solution to
                    this: a new website design, a new logo, new categorization etc… So it’s well structured now :)</p>

                    being an architect to being an illustrator. I’ve REDISCOVERED my CHILDHOOD PASSIONS: PENCILS, PAPER
                    and PAINT! This discovery has been both eye opening and motivational. It’s also very exciting to
                    learn (little by little) more about breaking away from the standard 9-5 job and currently exploring
                    the pros and cons of working for yourself.

                    What about you? Do you still follow your childhood passions? Or if you can’t remember what those
                    are, ask your parents, your sister, brother… you might find something life changing! :)</p>

                    system – you can do this with a pencil and paper; draw the menu boxes and name them, then list the
                    sub-menu items if any. Once you know what content you are planning to include on your website, you
                    can summarize what you offer into your homepage Welcome Message.Popular Articles

                <p class="p sectionSubtag text-small">Sometimes the above approach can make the purpose of your website
                    so obvious that you don’t need to state the purpose in words. Some of the biggest and most popular
                    websites do not have a welcome message – for example youtube.com, cnet.com, microsoft.com. The
                    modern trend towards not wasting any words on your homepage can mean this is a good approach, as
                    long as you make it obvious to your users on your homepage what they can achieve and find on your
                    website! Have you ever visited a website where you had absolutely no idea what the site was about?
                    Chances are, you exited the site quickly then forgot it. Confusing sites are forgettable sites.</p>
